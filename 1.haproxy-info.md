## How HAproxy helps improve mysql performance

### pre test: push to the limit

server1: mysql server
ip: 192.168.1.246
cpu: 1, ram: 1G

server2: mysqlslap, haproxy
ip: 192.168.1.247
cpu: 1, ram: 1G

* first learn the limit of mysql server: (in real app, may test most time consuming or cpu consuming queries)

```bash
#- run mysqlslap tool at server2,192.168.1.247
#- concurrent level 220
#- iterations 5 : run 5 times and then calculate average.
#- number-of-queries 30000 : total querys in one test.

mysqlslap --create-schema=test --user=root --password=xxxxxxx \
-h 192.168.1.246 -P 3306 \
--query="select * from a;" \
--concurrency=220 --iterations=5 \
--number-of-queries=30000 

Benchmark
Average number of seconds to run all queries: 6.645 seconds
Minimum number of seconds to run all queries: 6.568 seconds
Maximum number of seconds to run all queries: 6.756 seconds
Number of clients running queries: 220
Average number of queries per client: 136

#- change concurrent level to 240
Benchmark
Average number of seconds to run all queries: 6.758 seconds
Minimum number of seconds to run all queries: 6.650 seconds
Maximum number of seconds to run all queries: 6.852 seconds
Number of clients running queries: 240
Average number of queries per client: 125

#- increase concurrent level to 260
Average number of seconds to run all queries: 6.540 seconds
Minimum number of seconds to run all queries: 6.418 seconds
Maximum number of seconds to run all queries: 6.653 seconds
Number of clients running queries: 260
Average number of queries per client: 115

#- increate concurrent level to 280; failed, hanged
```

* though cocurrent=220 made system load more than 4.00, server2 survived until concurrent level > 260

### Case 1: under high concurrent level

* in the last example, high concurrency cause some hanged queries in mysql server thus lead to low performance.

  ("max_connections" system variable in mysql is not quit relevant to the concurrent level.)

* here comes haproxy to deal with this problem

  haproxy have a variable "maxconn" to limit concurrent connections passed to mysql

  lets say set maxconn=80, listen port 3308

  aggressively set concurrency=300

```bash
#- run mysqlslap tool at server2,192.168.1.247
#- note that mysqlslap connected to 192.168.1.247:3308

mysqlslap --create-schema=test --user=root --password=xxxxxxx \
-h 192.168.1.247 -P 3308 \
--query="select * from a;" \
--concurrency=300 --iterations=5 \
--number-of-queries=30000 

Benchmark
Average number of seconds to run all queries: 5.559 seconds
Minimum number of seconds to run all queries: 5.450 seconds
Maximum number of seconds to run all queries: 5.735 seconds
Number of clients running queries: 300
Average number of queries per client: 100
```

* Oh, average **5.559 seconds**. Quicker than concurrency=260 without HAproxy.

  HAproxy will certainly use cpu but that is another story.


* continuous tests: (seems like maxconn=80 is a better choice of haproxy setting for server1, poor testing machine)

```
#- change haproxy maxconn=100,120,140,180
